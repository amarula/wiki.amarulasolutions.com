Amarula Solutions has partnered with Radxa Limited and started a project
to push ROCK Pi Boards onto Mainline U-Boot, Linux Kernel, Yocto/Buildroot
and Multimedia Open source projects.

The first success was that we mainlined full functional ROCK PI 4 boards.

Along with Mainlining, we are also providing Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
Distribution running flawlessly on their SBC's.
