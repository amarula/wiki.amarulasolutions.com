Implementing Linux DRM drivers for DLPC3433 MIPI DSI Projectors
===============================================================

DLP-based projector technology has been evolved in multiple areas of
applications since it provides sharp, high-quality projections with
the potential for 3D capabilities.

Most of them are Texas Instrument chipsets based on optical micro-electro-mechanical
technology that uses a digital micromirror device.

DLPC3433 is one of the newer DPL-based MIPI DSI projectors which uses
most industrial and consumer electronics.

DLPC3433 block has three key sets of subsystems,

1. DLPC3433, interfaced from front-end SoC or other chipsets via Parallel,
   DSI for video, and I2C, SPI for configurations.
2. DLPA3000 is PMIC and High-CurrentLED driver
3. DMD, digital mirror device for Sub-LVDS output optics generation.

All the above subsystems are required to implement on respective Linux DRM
driver stacks to function properly.
