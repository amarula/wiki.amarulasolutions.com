Amarula Solutions has partnered with Engicam Srl and started a project
to push Engicam SOM’s and Carrier board’s BSP onto Mainline U-Boot,
Linux Kernel, Yocto/Buildroot and Multimedia Open source projects.

The first success was that we mainlined PX30-Core, which is a Rockchip PX30
based SOM along with two of its carrier boards namely EDIMM 2.2 and CTouch 2.0.

Along with Mainlining, we are also providing Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) Distribution
running flawlessly on their Carrier Boards.
