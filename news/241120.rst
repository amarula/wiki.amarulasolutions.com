==============================================================

Hardware::

        SoC: Rockchip RK3399
        SBC: ROC-RK3399-PC

Amarula Solutions has partnered with Libretech and started a project
to push Libre Computer Boards onto Mainline U-Boot, Linux Kernel, Buildroot
and Multimedia Open source projects.

The first success was that we mainlined full functional 
ROC-RK3399-PC(Renegade Elite) along with community  developers.

Along with Mainlining, we are also providing Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
Distribution running flawlessly on their SBC's.

Here is the Type C Power Delivery with Altmode Display Port support
in Linux-5.10. The Type-C chip FUSB302 still using Linux extcon framework
and the real work is yet to push on Mainline.
